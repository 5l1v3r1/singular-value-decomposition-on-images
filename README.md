# Singular Value Decomposition on Images

I was curious about singular value decompositions and it's effects on images decided to start this tiny side project. So I decomposed a grayscale image (**cat!**) and an rgb image (**dog!**) and re-composed from their decomposed matrices part by part. Below are some resulting images.

##Code

The code to recreate the decompositions/re-compositions are in the src folder. I only ended up using numpy and scipy packages for this project.

##Data

Two images are in /data/ folder. Sample outputs of summed up decompositions are in /data/sample_decomposition_results/.
